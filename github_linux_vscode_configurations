1. Make sure Git is installed & configured

Open a terminal in Linux Mint and run:
git --version

If it says “command not found” or similar:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

Then configure your Git identity (use the same email you use for GitHub):
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

You can confirm:
git config --global --list

2. Connect your machine to GitHub (SSH key)
This lets you push/pull without typing username/password or PAT all the time.
2.1 Generate an SSH key
In your terminal:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-github-email@example.com"

When it asks for file path, just press Enter (default: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519).
When it asks for a passphrase:
You can set one (more secure, recommended), or
Press Enter twice for none (less secure but simpler).
2.2 Start ssh-agent and add the key
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

(Optional but nice: ensure the agent starts automatically; we can do that later if you want.)

2.3 Add the SSH key to GitHub
Show the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Copy the whole line that starts with ssh-ed25519.
Then in your browser:
Go to GitHub → log in to your account (sprite007-stack).
Top-right avatar → Settings.
Left sidebar: SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key.
Title: e.g. Linux Mint VS Code
Key type: Authentication Key
Paste the key and click Add SSH key.
Test it:
ssh -T git@github.com

You should see something like:
Hi sprite007-stack! You've successfully authenticated...

3. Sign into GitHub from VS Code
Open VS Code on Linux Mint (v1.106).
Look at the Accounts icon in the bottom-left corner (little person icon).
Click it → Sign in with GitHub.
It’ll open a browser asking you to authorize VS Code / GitHub extension – accept.
Once done, VS Code should show you as signed in with your GitHub account.
If needed, install GitHub-related extensions:
Go to Extensions (square icon on left)
Search and install:
GitHub Pull Requests and Issues
(Optional) GitHub Repositories
These make interaction with GitHub much smoother.

4. Clone your GitHub repos into VS Code

Your repos are at:
https://github.com/sprite007-stack?tab=repositories
Pick one repo (say my-repo as an example).

Option A – Using VS Code UI (recommended)
In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette.
Type: Git: Clone → press Enter.
For URL, use either:

SSH (recommended):
git@github.com:sprite007-stack/my-repo.git

Or HTTPS:
https://github.com/sprite007-stack/my-repo.git

Choose a local folder (e.g. ~/Projects/github/).
Once clone finishes, VS Code will ask: “Open cloned repository?” → Open.
Now you’re in the repo workspace:
Source Control (branch icon on sidebar) shows changes.
You can edit, commit, push, pull all from here.
