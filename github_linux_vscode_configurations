Installing vscode
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux

1. Make sure Git is installed & configured

Open a terminal in Linux Mint and run:
git --version

If it says “command not found” or similar:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

Then configure your Git identity (use the same email you use for GitHub):
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

You can confirm:
git config --global --list

2. Connect your machine to GitHub (SSH key)
This lets you push/pull without typing username/password or PAT all the time.
2.1 Generate an SSH key
In your terminal:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-github-email@example.com"

When it asks for file path, just press Enter (default: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519).
When it asks for a passphrase:
You can set one (more secure, recommended), or
Press Enter twice for none (less secure but simpler).
2.2 Start ssh-agent and add the key
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

(Optional but nice: ensure the agent starts automatically; we can do that later if you want.)

2.3 Add the SSH key to GitHub
Show the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Copy the whole line that starts with ssh-ed25519.
Then in your browser:
Go to GitHub → log in to your account (sprite007-stack).
Top-right avatar → Settings.
Left sidebar: SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key.
Title: e.g. Linux Mint VS Code
Key type: Authentication Key
Paste the key and click Add SSH key.
Test it:
ssh -T git@github.com

You should see something like:
Hi sprite007-stack! You've successfully authenticated...

3. Sign into GitHub from VS Code
Open VS Code on Linux Mint (v1.106).
Look at the Accounts icon in the bottom-left corner (little person icon).
Click it → Sign in with GitHub.
It’ll open a browser asking you to authorize VS Code / GitHub extension – accept.
Once done, VS Code should show you as signed in with your GitHub account.
If needed, install GitHub-related extensions:
Go to Extensions (square icon on left)
Search and install:
GitHub Pull Requests and Issues
(Optional) GitHub Repositories
These make interaction with GitHub much smoother.

4. Clone your GitHub repos into VS Code

Your repos are at:
https://github.com/sprite007-stack?tab=repositories
Pick one repo (say my-repo as an example).

Option A – Using VS Code UI (recommended)
In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette.
Type: Git: Clone → press Enter.
For URL, use either:

SSH (recommended):
git@github.com:sprite007-stack/my-repo.git

Or HTTPS:
https://github.com/sprite007-stack/my-repo.git

Choose a local folder (e.g. ~/Projects/github/).
Once clone finishes, VS Code will ask: “Open cloned repository?” → Open.
Now you’re in the repo workspace:
Source Control (branch icon on sidebar) shows changes.
You can edit, commit, push, pull all from here.

5. Daily workflow in VS Code

Inside a cloned repo:

Make changes
Edit files as normal.
VS Code will show modified files in the Source Control panel.

Stage & commit
Click the Source Control icon (branch with circle).
Hover over a file → click + to stage, or click + at the top to stage all.
Enter a commit message in the box, e.g. Add initial config.
Hit Ctrl+Enter or click the checkmark to commit.

Push to GitHub
After committing, click the Sync Changes button (two arrows) or click the ellipsis … → Push.
VS Code will use your SSH auth and push to origin on GitHub.

Pull updates
When there are upstream changes:
Click Sync Changes again, or
Ctrl+Shift+P → Git: Pull

6. Quick sanity check

To verify everything is wired up:

Clone one repo from sprite007-stack.
Create a tiny change (e.g. add a comment to a file).
Commit + push from VS Code.
Refresh the repo page on GitHub in your browser and confirm the commit shows there.
If you tell me the name of one repo you want to start with, I can give you the exact clone URL and a mini “first commit” walkthrough tailored to it.

Option A (Recommended): Use ~/.ssh/config to auto-load keys

Linux Mint already uses gnome-keyring / ssh-agent under the hood.
You simply tell SSH to automatically use your key.

1. Create or edit your SSH config file
nano ~/.ssh/config

2. Add this block (safe, clean, recommended)
Host *
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

3. Save & exit

Press CTRL + O → Enter → CTRL + X.

4. Test it
ssh -T git@github.com

If it says “Hi sprite007-stack!” without asking for a password or key, it’s working.
