1. Connect the iDRAC Port

Every Dell PowerEdge has a dedicated out-of-band management port labeled:

iDRAC

or has “wrench” icon

Steps:

Plug an Ethernet cable into the dedicated iDRAC port.

Connect it to a management switch or any network with DHCP.

Power on the server (even if the OS is not installed, iDRAC boots independently).

2. Access the iDRAC Configuration Menu (BIOS Level)

During boot:

When you see the Dell logo, press
F2 → System Setup
OR
Ctrl + E → iDRAC Settings

Navigate to:
iDRAC Settings → Network

Here you can configure:

Enable NIC → Enabled

NIC Selection → Dedicated

IPv4 Settings

DHCP: On (or Off if using static)

IP Address

Subnet Mask

Gateway

Example Static Config:

IPv4: Enabled
DHCP: Disabled
IP: 192.168.1.50
Mask: 255.255.255.0
GW: 192.168.1.1


Press Apply, then Finish, and reboot if required.

3. Get the Default iDRAC Credentials

The default login depends on generation:

iDRAC8 (R730xd, older models)

User: root

Password: printed on white sticker on pull-out info tag under “iDRAC Password”.

iDRAC9 (R740xd and higher)

User: root

Password: printed on the service tag pull-out card under “iDRAC Password”.

4. Log In to the iDRAC Web Interface

Once network is configured:

Open a browser and enter the iDRAC IP:

https://192.168.1.50


Accept any certificate warnings.

Log in using:

Username: root

Password: (as printed on the server tag)

You should now see the iDRAC dashboard.

5. Change the Default Password (Highly Recommended)

Go to:

iDRAC Settings → User Authentication → Local Users → root → Edit

Set:

New password

Optional: disable unused accounts

6. Optional — Set Up iDRAC Networking Features
DNS Naming

iDRAC Settings → Network → Common Settings

iDRAC Name: servername-idrac

Register with DNS: Yes (optional)

Enable/Disable VLAN

If using management VLAN:

Enable VLAN: ON
VLAN ID: <your VLAN>
Priority: 1

7. Optional — Set Up Email Alerts

Go to:

iDRAC Settings → Alerts → SMTP

Configure:

SMTP Server

From Address

Recipients

Test email

8. Optional — Update iDRAC Firmware

Download firmware from Dell:
Search “iDRAC firmware R730xd” or “iDRAC9 firmware R740xd”

Upload via:
Maintenance → System Update

Keeps features and security patches current.

9. Optional — Assign a Static IP via RACADM CLI (Advanced)

If you cannot access BIOS:

Login via SSH or console:

racadm setniccfg -s 192.168.1.50 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1


Reboot iDRAC:

racadm racreset

10. Confirm iDRAC is Working

From a workstation:

ping 192.168.1.50


Open browser to that IP and verify:

System information is loading

Sensors are reporting correctly

You can open Virtual Console

You can mount ISOs



# A hardened security baseline for iDRAC

Below is a complete hardened security baseline for iDRAC8 & iDRAC9 specifically tuned for Dell R730xd/R740xd servers and homelab/enterprise environments. This is the same type of hardening you’d apply in a regulated production environment.

I structured it as:

Baseline Summary (Quick Mode)

Full Hardening Checklist (Recommended)

CLI (RACADM) Commands for Automation

Optional: Compliance Baseline (CIS-Style)

✅ 1. Hardened iDRAC Security Baseline (Quick Summary)

Minimum Requirements:

Disable root or change to long password

Create a named admin account (not “root”)

Disable all unused services (SSH, IPMI, SNMP, VNC, WSMAN, RACADM)

Enable TLS 1.2/1.3 only

Disable older ciphers

Enforce strong password policy

Enable session timeout (Defaults are insecure)

Restrict IP access (ACLs or firewall)

Disable virtual console plug-ins except HTML5

Keep iDRAC firmware fully updated

🔒 2. Full iDRAC Security Hardening Checklist
A. User Accounts & Authentication
1. Create a unique admin account
User: bryan-admin
Permissions: Administrator

2. Disable root login (recommended)

iDRAC Settings → Users → root → Disable
(Keep password stored offline)

3. Enforce Password Policy

Minimum length: 15+ characters

Require upper/lower/number/special

Max age: 365 days (optional for homelab)

Password lockout: 5 attempts

Lockout time: 15 minutes

B. Network Security Settings
1. Use a dedicated management VLAN
VLAN ID: <your ID>
Priority: 1

2. Disable unused NIC selection

Set:

NIC = Dedicated


Disable LOM failover unless required.

3. Restrict IPs with the built-in ACL

iDRAC Settings → Network → Access Control

Example:

Allow: 10.0.0.0/24
Deny: 0.0.0.0/0

C. Encryption Settings
1. Disable insecure protocols

Turn OFF:

TLS 1.0

TLS 1.1

SSLv3

HTTP (force HTTPS only)

Turn ON:

TLS 1.2 (iDRAC9 supports TLS 1.3)

HTTPS Redirection

2. Disable weak ciphers

Recommended:

Enable only ECDHE_RSA and AES256 suites

D. Service Hardening (Most Important)

Disable everything except what you actively use:

Service	Recommendation
SSH	OFF unless automating
IPMI over LAN	OFF (major security risk)
VNC	OFF
WSMAN	OFF
SNMP	OFF unless monitoring
Virtual Console	HTML5 only
Redfish	ON (secure modern API)
RACADM	OFF unless scripting

Virtual Media:

Enable only when needed, then turn it off.

IPMI Over LAN is the biggest risk—disable this always.

E. Session Security
Set the following:

Web UI timeout: 10–15 mins

SSH timeout: 5 mins

Max concurrent sessions: 2

Disable “Keep me logged in”

RSTP Edge-Port: not related to security, but OK to leave enabled on switch ports for LACP

F. Logging, Monitoring, and Alerts
Enable:

System Event Log (SEL)

Lifecycle Controller log retention

Email alerts (SMTP)

Power events

Fan failures

Hardware errors

Intrusion detection

Configure:

Automatic SupportAssist Collection → Optional

Remote syslog (if you have a syslog server)

G. Firmware & Supply Chain Security

Update to latest iDRAC firmware

Enable:

Secure Boot
UEFI Secure Boot (BIOS)
Signed firmware updates only
Block downgrade


Disable:

Auto-firmware rollback
Unauthorized BIOS changes

H. Physical Security

Enable:

Chassis intrusion detection

Tamper alert emails

Optional:

Set BIOS admin password

Disable boot order modifications

Disable USB booting

🖥️ 3. RACADM Commands for Automated Hardening
